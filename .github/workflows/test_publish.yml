        #   # For musl, you might need to install `rustup target add aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`

        #     # If `napi build --platform` doesn't work out of the box for ARM64 on x64 Linux runner,
        #     # you might need a dedicated ARM64 runner or more complex cross-compilation setup.
        #     # NAPI-RS handles cross-compilation quite well generally.
